# üîß Deployment Fix Applied

## Issues Fixed:

‚úÖ **Python Version Issue**: Added `.python-version` file specifying Python 3.11  
‚úÖ **lxml Compatibility**: Removed lxml dependency (not needed - using built-in xml.etree)  
‚úÖ **Cleaned Dependencies**: Updated to working versions compatible with Python 3.11

## What Was Changed:

1. **Added `.python-version` file** in `ai_compliance/Backend/` with content: `3.11`
2. **Updated `requirements.txt`** to remove problematic dependencies:
   - ‚ùå Removed: `lxml==4.9.3` (not used in code)
   - ‚ùå Removed: `httpx==0.27.2` (not needed)  
   - ‚ùå Removed: `pathlib2==2.3.7` (deprecated)
   - ‚úÖ Kept essential dependencies with compatible versions

## Current Requirements:
```
flask==3.0.3
flask-cors==4.0.0
python-dotenv==1.0.1
openai==1.51.0
requests==2.31.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
```

## Next Steps:

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Fix Python 3.13 compatibility issues and clean dependencies"
git push
```

### 2. Trigger New Build on DigitalOcean
- Go back to your DigitalOcean App Platform
- The new build should automatically detect the changes
- It will now use Python 3.11 instead of 3.13
- All dependencies should install successfully

### 3. Expected Build Success
The build should now:
- ‚úÖ Use Python 3.11 (specified in `.python-version`)
- ‚úÖ Install all dependencies without compilation errors
- ‚úÖ Start your Flask app with Gunicorn
- ‚úÖ Pass health checks

## Why This Fixes the Issue:

- **lxml 4.9.3** is not compatible with Python 3.13 due to C extension compilation issues
- Your code uses **built-in `xml.etree.ElementTree`**, so lxml was unnecessary
- **Python 3.11** is stable and supported by all your dependencies
- **Simplified dependencies** reduce potential compatibility issues

## Verification:

After the build succeeds, you should be able to:
1. Access your backend at: `https://your-app-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app`
2. Test the health endpoint: `https://your-app-xxxxx.ondigitalocean.app/api/health`
3. Upload XML files and get compliance analysis

Your app is now ready for production! üöÄ
